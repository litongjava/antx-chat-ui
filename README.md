# AntX Chat UI

## Introduction

AntX Chat UI is a front-end chat interface built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Ant Design X**. It offers a sleek and intuitive user experience designed for AI-driven applications, with a particular focus on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) solutions.

Key highlights include:

- **OpenAI Protocol for Communication**: The front end communicates with the back end using OpenAI’s protocol.
- **No Local Chat Logs**: All chat logs are stored on the back end. The front end does not store or cache any conversation data.

## Features

- **React** and **TypeScript** for a robust, maintainable codebase.
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development.
- **Ant Design X** integration for a modern, elegant interface.
- **Markdown** support for rich text rendering.
- Organized tabs for categorized conversations (e.g., *Hot Topics*, *Design Guide*).
- Smooth user interactions and enhanced UI responsiveness.

## Markdown Support

The chat interface supports Markdown syntax for rich text formatting. Users can write messages with Markdown, which will be rendered in the chat window.

### Supported Markdown Elements

- **Headings**
- **Bold and Italic Text**
- **Lists** (ordered and unordered)
- **Links**
- **Images**
- **Code Blocks**

## Communication Protocol

This project uses the **OpenAI** protocol to handle interactions between the front end and the back end. All chat requests and responses flow through this protocol, ensuring a consistent and secure data exchange for AI-driven features.

## Data Storage

To maintain user privacy and ensure optimal data consistency:

- **Front End**: Does **not** store any chat logs locally.
- **Back End**: Manages and stores all conversation history.

This approach ensures that user data remains safe and that any data manipulations or retrievals happen strictly on the server side.

## Customization

You can tailor the UI and functionality by updating the following:

- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components.
- **src/pages/**: Page-level components and layouts.
- **src/styles/**: Global styles, theming, and CSS/SCSS files.
